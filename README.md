Hi there! We are two high schoolers with a unique idea to improve our community. Throughout our lives, we have noticed that many homeowners have fruit trees that produce high volumes of fruit that either go unpicked or fall to the ground and go bad. Our solution to this issue is [website name]; without free service, homeowners with a surplus of fruits can register to have their fruit picked and keep a portion for themselves. The rest is donated to charity (villageharvest.org) and put to good use. We aim to take fresh, tasty fruit that would otherwise get wasted and give it to communities that need it.

Please get in touch with us if you want your fruits picked **for free** at adityajha2008@gmail.com. :apple:
